# gomoku

One of my quality pet-projects at `42`. 

## About

[`Gomoku`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) is a strategy board games. Goal of the game is to put your 5 
stoens in a row (It is also called Five-in-a-Row). This game has lots of variations. 
The original one is no more applied, because first player can win the game
[regardless of the opponent's moves](regardless of the opponent's moves).  

My aim was to code game interface and an Engine for one of variations.
